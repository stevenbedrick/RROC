RROC: Dead-simple ROC analysis in Ruby
==========

This library provides methods for Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) calculation based on an algorithm copied from the [ML-Mathematica](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/ML-Math/) set of machine learning demonstrations, ported by Steven Bedrick ([steve@bedrick.org](mailto:steve@bedrick.org)). Any bugs are mine and not the original authors'. For an excellent overview of ROC analysis, check out:

Installation
--------

    gem install rroc

Usage
--------

Using RROC is very simple. It expects to be given data in the form of a _n_x2 matrix (i.e., an Array of 2-element Arrays) representing the output of a binary classifier. Each row represents a "case" (document, data point, etc.); the first column represents the classifier's discriminant value and the second column represents the ground-truth class label for that case. RROC expects class labels in the form of either 1 or -1; larger discriminant values should be associated with membership in class 1. You can determine the area under the ROC curve as follows:

    require 'rroc'
    
    my_data = open('some_data.csv').readlines.collect { |l| l.strip.split(",").map(&:to_f) }
    auc = ROC.auc(my_data)
    puts auc
    
If you want to obtain a set of points describing the ROC curve itself, you can do that by calling the `ROC.curve_points` method:

    require 'rroc'

    my_data = open('some_data.csv').readlines.collect { |l| l.strip.split(",").map(&:to_f) }
    pts = ROC.curve_points(my_data) # returns something like: [[0.0, 0.0], [0.1, 0.01]... ]
    
The points are returned as an Array of two-element Arrays, each of which contains an X and a Y coordinate that you may then export or plot using the utility of your choice. For example, together with the `googlecharts` gem, you can obtain a Google Chart link that will display your ROC curve:


    require 'gchart' 
    require 'rroc'

    my_data = open('some_data.csv').readlines.collect { |l| l.strip.split(",").map(&:to_f) }
    pts = ROC.curve_points(my_data)
    puts Gchart.scatter(:data => [pts.collect { |x| x[0] }, pts.collect { |x| x[1] }])

Conclusion
---------
RROC is designed to be a tool for bare-bones ROC analysis in Ruby; take it for what it is and use it at your own risk. Bug reports, forks, and patches are more than welcome!
